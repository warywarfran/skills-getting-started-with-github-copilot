I can see you've shared a FastAPI endpoint for activity signup. To help you modify this code, I need to know what changes you'd like to make. 

Could you clarify:
1. What specific modification do you need?
2. Are there any issues with the current implementation?
3. What's the desired outcome?

For example, are you looking to:
- Add validation (email format, etc.)?
- Change how participants are stored?
- Add query parameters instead of path/query parameters?
- Modify the response format?
- Something else?

Please let me know what you'd like to improve!
